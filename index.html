Coding: the interest that we see tech-savvy, career driven boys pursue. But why? And more importantly, why boys?

Almost like some sort of secret society pitted against women, gender
normatives have encouraged boys to be innovative, while girls have been
programmed to be unproblematic and perfect. Today, I will be discussing
why girls should pursue coding, not for the money, not for the occupational
benefits, but for its creative outlet; an outlet that girls are particularly
excluded from.

Reflecting on my childhood, I remember my parents particularly buying my
brother legos and building blocks, while they bought me Barbie dolls. This may
not seem out of the ordinary in today’s gender normative society, but again,
I ask, why? Why is it that our society’s gender normativity has influenced
something so meaningless, like a toy?

Psychologically, Barbie dolls influence young girls to have an unachievable
standard of perfectionism, while legos teach boys how to be creative, as well as
learn from their mistakes. And if you haven’t already noticed, most male
dominant fields are not only higher paying, but include creative ability as a
prerequisite.

Engineering, and more specifically coding, is known for its creative elements.
Every project I make requires as much time to debug as it did to
conceptualize and write it. However, I find this to be the reason coding is
one of the most efficient ways I express my creativity. Solving an errored
code has sparked a level of creativity that I’ve never experienced before.

While coding is creative, it is also one of the most male dominated
industries. During my time at a coding internship, Girls Who Code, the
instructor warned us about the intimidation factor that is placed in an
engineering environment, such as a classroom or job. They warned us that we
will most likely be one of the only females representing in that group, but to
not be discouraged. I didn’t truly understand their advice until my first day
in college, where I was one of two girls in my Intro to Coding class; I was
shocked.

<font size = "6">
For centuries, men have had an unfair advantage in almost everything, including
occupation. It saddens me to think that society’s gender roles has influenced
men to pursue creative fields that include high pay, while women are more prone
to seek a field related to nurturing others that pays a fraction of the cost of
their male counterparts. Young girls should equally be encouraged not to
restrain from exploring and making mistakes, for it sparks creativity and
confidence, which is essential for a young girl to have in a man’s world.
In addition, I would like to sign off of my blog by challenging my female
viewers to take a coding class, and to not abide by the gender roles set by
the patriarchy — Yasamin
